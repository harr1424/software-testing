# Note: This file can be saved as commander.yaml and used to run all manual tests with one command
# ./commander.sh test

# Part One: Manual Functional Testing

# Program One: cat
# Functionality to verify: When cat <filename> is executed, the contents
# of <filename> should be printed to std::out
# Assumption(s): All characters contained within the file are ASCII
# characters, the program is not expected to send non-printing characters
# (\n, \t, etc) to std::out.
# Test text is contained inside  'file1.txt' and 'file2' the later
# intentionally has no extension. file1.txt contains one string
# 'herman melville' and file 2 contains the string '4 8 15 16 23 42'.
# The specific command executed will be cat file1.txt file2 > output.txt.
# Test evaluation will consist of reading output.txt to verify the text
# contained in the files is present.

tests:
    cat file1.txt:
        stdout: herman melville
        exit-code: 0
    cat file2: 
        stdout: 4 8 15 16 23 42
        exit-code: 0

# Program Two: sort
# Functionality to verify: sort should sort each line in the file passed as 
# an argument in relation to to other lines in the file. For example, lines 
# beginning with numbers should be printed to std::out before lines beginning
# with letters, and a line beginning with the letter a should be printed to 
# std::out before a line beginning with the letter z. When two lines begin 
# with the same letter, subsequent letters in the line determine how they 
# are sorted. 
# Assumption(s): All characters contained within the file where sorting 
# is tested are ASCII and NOT non-printing characters. For example, the 
# file will contain some means of distinguishing newlines but if these 
# are newline characters they should not impact the sort aside from 
# delineating a newline. 
# Test Description: The file test_sort contains the following lines: 
# 1998
# bell
# cheetah
# circus
# gallop
# hamburger
# zeebra 
# Expected output is:
# 1998
# bell
# cheetah
# circus
# gallop
# hamburger
# zeebra
# using the -r flag should sort the list in reverse order
# creating a file test_sort_dups with duplicate lines, the duplicates should be 
# removed when using the -u flag
    sort test_sort:
        stdout:
            lines:
                1: "1998"
                2: bell
                3: cheetah
                4: circus
                5: gallop
                6: hamburger
                7: zeebra
        exit-code: 0
    sort -r test_sort:
        stdout:
            lines:
                1: zeebra
                2: hamburger
                3: gallop
                4: circus
                5: cheetah
                6: bell
                7: "1998"
        exit-code: 0
    sort -u test_sort:
        stdout:
            lines:
                1: "1998"
                2: bell
                3: cheetah
                4: circus
                5: gallop
                6: hamburger
                7: zeebra
        exit-code: 0
        
# Program Three: grep
# Functionality to verify: Given a string of text, the program should return 
# all lines of a file containing that text. 
# Assumptions: Text to search contains  ASCII characters only,
# the term searched for will appear on multiple lines.
# Test Description: The following sentence is the beginning to Moby Dick: 

# Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—
# having little or no money in my purse,
# and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
# I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

# Executing grep and grep_test should return the following output to std::out:

# and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
# I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

    output should match file:
        command: grep and grep_test
        stdout:
            file: output.txt
        exit-code: 0
